Welcome to my Portfolio where you can find various projects from a Data Science field. 

## List of currently available projects 

- **Train stations in Germany Web Scraping**
  - *In this project we will scrap live informations about departures and arrivals from particular train station in Germany. Seemingly simple task turns into tricky one when we discover that tables are operated by JavaScript and we need to use Selenium. We will also encounter some difficulties like accepting cookies, changing maximum number of rows in tables and many other.*
- **Cleaning US Census Data**
  - *Cleaning data is a crucial step in almost every data project. Famous quote says "garbage in garbage out" so in this project we will handle problems with US Census dataset. Project involves merging parts of dataset, removing duplicates, features manipulation using regular expressions and imputing missing values using KNN Imputer.*
- **Airline EDA**
  - *Properly performed data analysis allows to discover interesting trends in data and provides useful informations for businees decisions. In this project we will take on the role of a flighing company data analyst to do discover informations about passengers preferences and different aspects of flight. Project involves analyzing descriptive statistics, multivariate analysis, examinating feature correlation, chi square test and many more. Beautiful visualizations were taken using Matplotlib and Seaborn.* 
- **Heart Disease Hypothesis Testing**
  - *The aim of this project is to use statistical interference methods to reveal interesting informations about patients from Cleveland hospital suspected of heart disease. Due to fact that we want to test various statistical hypothesis in this particular project we will use R language which provides extensive libraries for statistical tests. To answer posed question we will use such methods as, for example T-tests,Chi Sqaure, Pearson Correlation, Shapiro-Wilk test, Kruskal-Wallis and many other.*
- **Bike Sharing Regression**
  - *Imagine you're working for a bike rental company and received task to build a model to predict number of bike rents based on provided by data enginner database from a last two years. In this project we will face this problem and try to provide as best model as it's possible. We will use bunch of machine learning techniques to first prepare our data to use ML models such as for example LinearRegression, Random Forests, XGBoost and Neural Network,  later compare performance of different algorithms and tune their parameters to finally find the best one.*
- **Credit Score Classification**
  - *One of the methods to estimate a credit risk is to use advanced machine learning models. In this project we will help one of the banks to build a mathematical model predicting credit score level. Provided data is in poor condition and require a lot of feature engineering. Process of preparating data involves advanced methods like SMOTE to deal with imbalanced target, PowerTransformer and many other. Testing models such as Logistic Regression, KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestRegressor, XGBoostClassifier and their hyperparameter tuning it's a trial-and-error method. Seeking for something even more powerful? The last part of the project is devoted to implementing a Neural Network. Curious of the results? Check them out !*
- **Mall Customers Clustering**
  - *In this project we will help one of the shops to investigate what type of different customers are visiting them. In the opposite to supervised learning here we don't have any labels - only customer parameters so the task is slightly more difficult. We will try to answer questions like what features distinguish customers, how many different types of customers are visiting shop and many other. Among the methods we will use are Factor Analysis Of Mixed Data, KMeans, DBSCAN and Gaussian Mixtures. Since methods like GridSearch has been designed with a view to tuning supervised models there was a need to write custom GridSearch class which eventually has got even more feauters than the original one. Comparing different algoritms is possible thanks to Silhouette score. See for yourself how interactive 3D Plots from Plotly and prediction methods are working.*
- **Licence plates Image Classification using CNN**
  - *The exploration of possibilities offered by deep learning is an amazing experience. Imagine you're working for an autonomous vehicles company and received a task to build a model predicting licence's state from picture. In this project we will build a classifier using USA plates dataset consisting of almost 10K plate's images from 56 different regions. Project involves using two dimesional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).*
- **USA President's Speeches NLP**
  - *Reading long texts takes a lot of time. Moreover it's impossible to focus on every aspect of text at once. Natural Language Processing comes with a bunch of methods to analyze text files. Starting from cleaning and preprocessing text using lemmatizaion, tokenization and removing stop words  to recognizing named entity or generating text summaries. In this project we will work on USA President's speeches to extract important informations from each speech and in the end compare them. Project involves using Wordclouds, Sentiment Analysis, Information Extraction (NER), Topic Modelling (LDA), Text Similarity and generating summaries using LuhnSummarizer.*
- **Motorway Speedometer OpenCV**
  - *Imagine you are working for a police traffic department. Recently you have noticed an increase in the number of recordings from highways during which speeding occurs. You decided to create a software to estimate vehicle speed on the motorway from video. At the first glance problem seems to be a hard nut to crack but here is a smart solution. Each two traffic bollards are located in the distance of 100m. The idea is to recognize and track bollard until car passes them what means end of previous sector and start of new one. If, in addition we measure elapsed time in each sector we can easly calculate sector average speed. This project has been wrtitten using OpenCV and has following features:*
    - *bollard detection and tracking*
    - *presenting sector separator line*
    - *dynamic road sensor color*
    - *displaying live informations like current program mode or last stage speed*
    - *presenting end summary*
